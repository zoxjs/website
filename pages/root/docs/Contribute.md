There are a lot of ways you can help the Zox.js project.

If you have founds issues on the official docs website
you can report them [here](https://github.com/zoxjs/zoxjs.com-source/issues/new).

You can report bugs for the main project [here](https://github.com/zoxjs/zox/issues/new).  
Same goes for all other project over at [GitHub](https://github.com/zoxjs?tab=repositories).

We also accept pool requests and all contributors
will be credited in the repo they contributed to.

Another great way you can help the community is by creating
your own modules and plugins that extend Zox.js and publishing them on [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com).
